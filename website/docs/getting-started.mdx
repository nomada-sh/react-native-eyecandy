# Getting Started

<div className="admonition admonition-info alert alert--info">
  <div className="admonition-content">
    React Native Eyecandy is a library of reusable UI components for React
    Native, it includes a wide variety of components like buttons, text inputs,
    icons, and more. The goal of this library is to create a set of reusable
    components that have a consistent look and feel across different projects.
    By doing this, we hope to make it easier for React Native developers to
    create beautiful and user-friendly apps.

## Installation

This library requires the following packages to be installed correctly:

- [react-native-gesture-handler](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-gesture-handler)
- [react-native-reanimated](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated)
- [react-native-svg](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg)
- [react-native-haptic-feedback](https://github.com/junina-de/react-native-haptic-feedback)
- [react-native-image-picker](https://github.com/react-native-image-picker/react-native-image-picker)
- [@react-native-masked-view/masked-view](https://github.com/react-native-masked-view/masked-view)

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @nomada-sh/react-native-eyecandy
```

### Installing dependencies into an Expo managed project

1. In your project directory, run:

  ```sh
  expo install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated react-native-svg react-native-haptic-feedback react-native-image-picker @react-native-masked-view/masked-view
  ```

2. To finalize installation of `react-native-gesture-handler`, add the following at the **top** (make sure it's at the top and there's nothing else before it) of your entry file, such as `index.js` or `App.js`:

  ```js
  import 'react-native-gesture-handler';
  ```

  > Note: If you are building for Android or iOS, do not skip this step, or your app may crash in production even if it works fine in development. This is not applicable to other platforms.

3. To finalize installation of `react-native-reanimated`, add Reanimated's babel plugin to your `babel.config.js`:

  ```js
  module.exports = {
    plugins: ['react-native-reanimated/plugin'],
  };
  ```

  After you add the Babel plugin, restart your development server and clear the bundler cache: `expo start --clear`

### Installing dependencies into a bare React Native project

1. In your project directory, run:

  ```bash npm2yarn
  npm install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated react-native-svg react-native-haptic-feedback react-native-image-picker @react-native-masked-view/masked-view
  ```

  From React Native 0.60 and higher, [linking is automatic](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/autolinking.md). So you **don't need to run** `react-native link`.

  If you're on a Mac and developing for iOS, you need to install the pods (via [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/)) to complete the linking.

  ```sh
  npx pod-install ios
  ```

2. To finalize installation of `react-native-gesture-handler`, add the following at the **top** (make sure it's at the top and there's nothing else before it) of your entry file, such as `index.js` or `App.js`:

  ```js
  import 'react-native-gesture-handler';
  ```

  > Note: If you are building for Android or iOS, do not skip this step, or your app may crash in production even if it works fine in development. This is not applicable to other platforms.

3. To finalize installation of `react-native-reanimated`, configure it following the [installation guide](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/installation).
